Question 3 
Has crime gotten better or worse over the last 9 years?
Crime levels peak in the Phoenix area in 2017. They remained relatively high until around 2019 where we can see that they started to noticeable decline. The steady decline continues all the way through 2024. This suggests that while crime was particularly high during the mid-to-late 2010s we can see an overall improvement in the last few years.



Question 4 
What are the peak times for crimes to occur?
We can see several peak times for crime throughout this chart. The first peak that we see is at midnight, then crime drops significantly until the early morning. Where we see another peak starting around 5 am. Then the most significant time of the day that we see crimes occurring is at 7 am. We see a steady decrease following this peak through the late morning and early afternoon. But see another peak starting again around 3 pm. After this last peak of the day crime rates generally decline into the later evening hours. The patterns we see here suggest that crime is influenced heavily on human activity levels. Peaking when most people are out during the rush hours of the day. 





Overall Summary
The analysis of crime in the Phoenix Area shows that residential locations specifically single-family homes and apartments account for the majority of reported crimes (nearly 59%). Public spaces like parking lots, streets and retail stores are also seeing a significant amount of crime. Across all locations in the Phoenix area the crime that is committed the most is larceny-theft. This indicated a strong trend in property related crimes within the area. However, we do see that the crimes are not distributed evenly across all zip codes with the Phoenix Area. Zip Code 85015 stands out with the highest crime especially when it comes to theft related incidents. 
These findings should help the Police force in the Greater Phoenix Area enhance patrols to help lower crime rates in residential areas.  They should be able to have more patrols out at peak crime hours to help reduce incidents during those times. In addition, these findings will also help them understand the patterns that have emerged over time and should allow them to take steps to improve the overall public safety in Phoenix
