Qustion 1
     What are the top 10 zip codes in the greater Phoenix area with the highest crimes?

Analysis - See Chart titled "Crime Distribution per Top 10 Zip Codes"
     This chart looks at crime in ten specific zip codes, and it shows that theft is the most common crime by far.  One zip code, 85015, stands out as having a lot more crime overall than the others, especially theft.  While other crimes like assault and burglary also happen, they're less frequent, and murder and rape are thankfully very rare in all these areas. Some other zip codes, like 85041, tend to have lower crime numbers.  Basically, if you're concerned about crime, 85015 seems to be the riskiest of these ten areas, but it's important to remember this chart only shows some types of crime, and doesn't consider how many people live in each zip code.


Question 2
    What are the most occuring crimes per zip code?

Analysis - See Chart titled "Types of Crimes per Top 10 Zip Codes"
    This chart shows the total number of crimes in the ten zip codes with the most crime.  The biggest takeaway is that zip code 85015 stands out as having a significantly higher number of crimes compared to all other zip codes in the top 10.  There's a substantial drop in crime between 85015 and the next highest, 85008, emphasizing the outlier status of 85015.  After this initial drop, the decrease in crime numbers across the remaining zip codes is more gradual. This suggests 85015 has a crime concentration, likely due to socioeconomic factors and policing strategies. However, the chart only looks at the top ten worst areas and doesn't consider population size.
