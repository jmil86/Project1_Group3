Question 1
Where are the top 10 locations crimes are happening in Phoenix? 
Crime incidents are concentrated in a mix of residental, public and commercial locations. We see that overall the most crimes that are taking place are happening at single-family homes. Followed closely by apartments. 



Question 2
What are the 10 most common crimes and where are they happening?â€‹
The most frequest crimes that are occuring are Burglary, Larceny-Theft, and Motor Vehicle Theft. We see these happening most frequently in residental ares, parking lots, retail stores and vechicles. Overall we see that Burglary's at single-family homes is the most reported crime. 


Question 3 
Has crime gotten better or worse over the last 9 years?
Crime levels peak in the Phoenix area in 2017. They remained relatively high until around 2019 where we can see that they started to noticeable decline. The steady decline continues all the way through 2024. This suggests that while crime was particularly high during the mid-to-late 2010s we can see an overall improvement in the last few years.



Question 4 
What are the peak times for crimes to occur?
We can see several peak times for crime throughout this chart. The first peak that we see is at midnight, then crime drops significantly until the early morning. Where we see another peak starting around 6 am. Then the most significant time of the day that we see crimes occurring is at 7 am. We see a steady decrease following this peak through the late morning and early afternoon. But see another peak starting again around 3 pm. After this last peak of the day crime rates generally decline into the later evening hours. The patterns we see here suggest that crime is influenced heavily on human activity levels. Peaking when most people are out during the rush hours of the day. 



Qustion 5
     What are the top 10 zip codes in the greater Phoenix area with the highest crimes?

Analysis - See Chart titled "Crime Distribution per Top 10 Zip Codes"
     This chart looks at crime in ten specific zip codes, and it shows that theft is the most common crime by far.  One zip code, 85015, stands out as having a lot more crime overall than the others, especially theft.  While other crimes like assault and burglary also happen, they're less frequent, and murder and rape are thankfully very rare in all these areas. Some other zip codes, like 85041, tend to have lower crime numbers.  Basically, if you're concerned about crime, 85015 seems to be the riskiest of these ten areas, but it's important to remember this chart only shows some types of crime, and doesn't consider how many people live in each zip code.


Question 6
    What are the most occuring crimes per zip code?

Analysis - See Chart titled "Types of Crimes per Top 10 Zip Codes"
    This chart shows the total number of crimes in the ten zip codes with the most crime.  The biggest takeaway is that zip code 85015 stands out as having a significantly higher number of crimes compared to all other zip codes in the top 10.  There's a substantial drop in crime between 85015 and the next highest, 85008, emphasizing the outlier status of 85015.  After this initial drop, the decrease in crime numbers across the remaining zip codes is more gradual. This suggests 85015 has a crime concentration, likely due to socioeconomic factors and policing strategies. However, the chart only looks at the top ten worst areas and doesn't consider population size.

Within these, the top locations with more than 5% crime rates are: Single family house, apartment, parking lot, street/roadway/sidewalk, department/discount store. Overall, these are the residential areas (58.7% crime rates) and open space zones.

Within the top premise types, the top 5 crime categories are listed. While the #2-#5 crime varies by premise type and location based, the top crime category for each premise type is always larceny-theft. This is a universal crime category happening across all premise types, matching to the bulk crime category analysis.

3. For the top crime categories, when do they trend to happen?

For crime categories (over 5%), they tend to happen more in the morning around 7am, corresponding to Larceny theft and motor vehicle theft/burglary.

Overall Summary
The analysis of crime in the Phoenix Area shows that residential locations specifically single-family homes and apartments account for the majority of reported crimes (nearly 59%). Public spaces like parking lots, streets and retail stores are also seeing a significant amount of crime. Across all locations in the Phoenix area the crime that is committed the most is larceny-theft. This indicated a strong trend in property related crimes within the area. However, we do see that the crimes are not distributed evenly across all zip codes with the Phoenix Area. Zip Code 85015 stands out with the highest crime especially when it comes to theft related incidents. 
These findings should help the Police force in the Greater Phoenix Area enhance patrols to help lower crime rates in residential areas.  They should be able to have more patrols out at peak crime hours to help reduce incidents during those times. In addition, these findings will also help them understand the patterns that have emerged over time and should allow them to take steps to improve the overall public safety in Phoenix
